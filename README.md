# Term-Project
This is the readme.md file for the term project in Getting and Cleaning Data--Course ID: getdata-030 amd I am CaptP.
We have a series of data sets from Samsung Phones monitoring the movements of 30 people doing 6 different things(Walking, etc).
Each measurement is ecpressed as 561 variations of acceleration, velocity, as jerk ( third derivative) etc.
The r script, run_analysis.R, takes a series of files of this data,  (Notably in two parts the test and training parts) and 
recombines this data, adds column headings and finally takes the averages of for each subject and activity. (Such as walking.)
It was an interesting project.
